# Cd Last Shell

Little easy script which open the new bash terminal in the last visited
directory.

**Warning !**

This script overload the use of *cd* command.


# Requirement

  * (bash) should be compatible with other shell languages with little fixes
  * .bash_last_shell_path file in your ~ directory

# Install

  * Copy the terminaCdLast.sh script into your .bashrc
  * reload your bashrc

# Why ?

  I was upset when a needed multiple terminal for a project to change directory
  into the one I was working in. This save me a lot of time.

  And it's very pleasant for a i3 user.
